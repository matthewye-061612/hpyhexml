    '''
    Precompute the neighbor index map for a hexagonal grid of a given radius.

    This function uses a HexEngine instance to calculate the indices of neighboring hexes
    for each hex in the grid. The neighbors are defined as the six hexes surrounding a
    center hex, plus the center hex itself, creating a kernel of size 7.

    Parameters:
        radius (int): The radius of the hexagonal grid.
    Returns:
        map (dict[int, tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, int]]): A dictionary mapping each hex index to
        a tuple of indices of its neighbors. The tuple contains the indices of the six neighbors
        and the index of the center hex itself. If a neighbor does not exist (i.e., it is outside the grid),
        its index will be -1.

    A Keras layer that implements hexagonal convolution using precomputed neighbor indices.
    This layer applies a hexagonal convolution operation to the input tensor, using a fixed kernel size of 7,

    The layer uses precomputed neighbor indices to efficiently gather the values from the input tensor

        This method computes and caches the neighbor indices for the given input shape,
