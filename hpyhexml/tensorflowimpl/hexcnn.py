    Precompute the neighbor index map for a hexagonal grid of a given radius.

    This function uses a HexEngine instance to calculate the indices of neighboring hexes
    for each hex in the grid. The neighbors are defined as the six hexes surrounding a
    center hex, plus the center hex itself, creating a kernel of size 7.

    Parameters:
        radius (int): The radius of the hexagonal grid.
    Returns:
        map (dict[int, tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, int]]): A dictionary mapping each hex index to
        a tuple of indices of its neighbors. The tuple contains the indices of the six neighbors
        and the index of the center hex itself. If a neighbor does not exist (i.e., it is outside the grid),

class HexConv(Layer):
    '''
    A Keras layer that implements hexagonal convolution using precomputed neighbor indices.
    This layer applies a hexagonal convolution operation to the input tensor, using a fixed kernel size of 7,

    The layer uses precomputed neighbor indices to efficiently gather the values from the input tensor
    based on the hexagonal grid structure.

    def __init__(self, output_dim: int, shrink: bool=False, **kwargs):
        '''
        Initialize the HexConv layer with the specified output dimension.

        The output dimension should be defined here as the number of output features for the convolution operation.
        The input dimension is determined by the input shape during the build phase.

        Shrink is a boolean parameter that determines whether to apply shrinking to the output. When set to True, 
        the output hexagonal grid will be shrunken to a smaller radius. For example, if the input has a radius of 4 (37 blocks),
        setting shink to True will reduce the output radius to 3 (19 blocks). This is natural for convolutional layers.
        When set to False, the output will have the same radius as the input, but when encountering invalid neighbors,
        their values will be padded with zeros.

        Because of the nature of convolutional layers, the shrink parameter does not affect the weights.

        Parameters:
            output_dim (int): The number of output features for the convolution operation.
            shink (bool): Whether to apply shinking to the output. Defaults to False.

        Recompute the neighbor indices for the given number of blocks.
        This method repopulates the indices cache for the specified number of blocks,
        ensuring that the neighbor indices are up-to-date and valid for the hexagonal grid structure.

        Note:
            The result produced by this method is dependent on the `shrink` parameter. Whether the grid
            is shrunken or not will affect the indices that are returned. Since the parameter should be
            set during initialization for the entire layer, it is not necessary to be able to adapt dynamically
            to different behaviors.

            When `shrink` is set to True, the output hexagonal grid will be shrunken to a smaller radius.
            This is achieved by requiring that all indices in the neighbor map are valid (not -1) for them to be included.
            For example, if the input has a radius of 4 (37 blocks), setting `shrink` to True will reduce the output radius to 3 (19 blocks).
            This is natural for convolutional layers.

            When `shrink` is set to False, the output will have the same radius as the input, and this method will set the indices of invalid
            neighbors to -1, allowing them to be included in the output but masked out later.

        All results are cached in the `indices_cache` attribute of the HexConv instance for future use.
